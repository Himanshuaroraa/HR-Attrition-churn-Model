Human Resources are critical resources of any organiazation. Organizations spend huge amount of time and money to hire
and nuture their employees. It is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources.
So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it will allow them to identify the attrition
risks and help understand and provie necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to minimize the
impact to the orgranization.
